        <li>Project 1</li>
        <p>This is a Java-based game, which is inspired by <em>Reigns</em> 
            and <em>The Hunger Games</em>. Throught it, I learnt about 
            fundemental knowledge about Software Design. For example, 
            UMLs for designing and orgnizing the whole project and design 
            principles and patterns for the correctness and validation 
            of codes.</p>
